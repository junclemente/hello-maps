# Google Maps Javascript API

Exploring the Google Maps Javascript API.

## Get Your Own API

To be able to use Google's Javascript API, you must use your own API. 
You can get your own here: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key "Get API Key")

## How To Use

At the bottom of each HTML page, I added a call to a script (js/mapkey.js) to protect my API Key. To use the page, you must remove the call to the script and replace it with the following: 
`<script async defer src="https://https://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY></script>`

Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your own personal API Key. 
The source for the script I used in 'js/mapkey.js' was taken from [https://jsfiddle.net/user2314737/7cfpxpf7/](https://jsfiddle.net/user2314737/7cfpxpf7/ "JS Fiddle")
